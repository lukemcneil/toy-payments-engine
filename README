This is a toy payments engine written in Rust. It handles deposits, withdrawals, disputes, resolved, and chargebacks.

Crates used
  - serde to do csv serialization and deserialization
  - csv for reading and writing csv's
  - rust_decimal for a safe way to store amounts (rather than floats with have rounding issues)
  - anyhow to make error handling a lot easier
  - assert_cmd to write an integration test to actually call the executable

To run the test do
```
cargo run -- transactions.csv > accounts.csv
```
and see the results in accounts.csv.

Some tests can be found in tests.rs.

By default, if a transaction cannot be executed for any reason it will silently fail and have no effect. A println can be commented out in the code to see these errors.
